Four numbers solver

In the second part of the homework, we will implement
a solver for the four numbers puzzle.
We saw this puzzle in lecture 0.
- [Lecture 0 Demo](https://github.com/DavisPL-Teaching/189C/blob/main/lecture0/z3-demo.py).

Your solver will take as input four numbers.
We have written this part for you.
