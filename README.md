# Homework 2: Z3 and Satisfiability

## Getting started

**Reminder:**
This assignment will be submitted through GitHub classroom.
To "submit" the assignment, push your changes to your repository.
Please see [this Piazza post](https://piazza.com/class/lt90i40zrot3ue/post/48) for further instructions.

You will also need Z3 installed, which you should
have installed from HW0. To double check, run `z3 --version`, you should get something like:
```
Z3 version 4.13.0 - 64 bit
```
(a different version is probably OK.)
You may need to `pip3 install z3-solver` if you are
using codespaces or if you are on a fresh machine.

## Assignment

Like HW1, there are three parts to the assignment:
- Part 1 is a series of mini exercises.
- Part 2 is a solver for the "four numbers" game that we
played on the first day of class.
- Part 3 explores some of the limitations of Z3.

There is also a helper file, `helper.py` that contains some useful
functions when working with Z3.

To continue, open and edit the files `part1.py`, `part2.py`, and `part3.py`.
