# Homework 2: Z3 and Satisfiability

## Getting started

To start the assignment, clone your repository.
Reminder: you will submit the assignment by committing
and pushing your code.
Please see [this Piazza post](https://piazza.com/class/lt90i40zrot3ue/post/48) for further instructions.

You will also need Z3 installed, which you should
have installed from HW0. To double check, run `z3 --version`, you should get something like:
```
Z3 version 4.13.0 - 64 bit
```
(a different version is probably OK.)
You may need to `pip3 install z3-solver` if you are
using codespaces or if you are on a fresh machine.

## Assignment

There are three parts to the assignment.
- Part 1 is a series of mini exercises, similar to HW1.
- Part 2 is a solver for the "four numbers" game that we
played on the first day of class; see [Lecture 0 Demo](https://github.com/DavisPL-Teaching/189C/blob/main/lecture0/z3-demo.py).
- Part 3 explores the performance limitations of Z3.

To continue, open and edit the files `part1.py`, `part2.py`, and `part3.py`.
