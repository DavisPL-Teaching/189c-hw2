# Homework 2: Z3 and Satisfiability

## Due date: Friday, February 6

## Getting started

You will need to have Z3 installed; see [Homework 0](https://github.com/DavisPL-Teaching/189c-hw0).
To double check, run `z3 --version`, you should get something like:
```
Z3 version 4.15.0 - 64 bit
```
(a different version is probably OK.)
You may need to `pip3 install z3-solver` if you are
using codespaces or if you are on a fresh machine.

As with HW1, you will submit your homework through Gradescope.
You can find the Gradescope link through Canvas.
Please see [this Piazza post](https://piazza.com/class/mk1iqtdmipw1z/post/40) for further important instructions on submitting your files.

## Assignment

Like HW1, there are three parts to the assignment:
- Part 1 is a series of mini exercises.
- Part 2 is a solver for a "four numbers" guessing game:
  guess two numbers given a list of their sum, difference, product, and quotient.
- Part 3 explores some of the limitations of Z3.

Part 1 contains a small extra credit question.
We have provided a helper file, `helper.py` that contains some useful
functions when working with Z3.

To continue, open and edit the files `part1.py`, `part2.py`, and `part3.py`.

## Getting help

If you get stuck, take a look at the file `hints.md` for some hints.
Please also don't hesitate to ask questions on Piazza or drop by
office hours!
