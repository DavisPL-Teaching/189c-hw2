# Homework 2: Z3 and Satisfiability

## Due date: Friday, May 3

## Getting started

You will need to have Z3 installed; see [Homework 0](https://github.com/DavisPL-Teaching/189c-hw0).
To double check, run `z3 --version`, you should get something like:
```
Z3 version 4.13.0 - 64 bit
```
(a different version is probably OK.)
You may need to `pip3 install z3-solver` if you are
using codespaces or if you are on a fresh machine.

As with HW1, you will submit your homework through GitHub Classroom. Clone your copy of the repository, then push your changes to GitHub before the deadline.
Please see [this Piazza post](https://piazza.com/class/lt90i40zrot3ue/post/48) for further instructions.

## Assignment

Like HW1, there are three parts to the assignment:
- Part 1 is a series of mini exercises.
- Part 2 is a solver for the "four numbers" game that we
played on the first day of class.
- Part 3 explores some of the limitations of Z3.

There is also a Part 4, which is optional extra credit.

There is also a helper file, `helper.py` that contains some useful
functions when working with Z3.

To continue, open and edit the files `part1.py`, `part2.py`, and `part3.py`.

## Getting help

A few of the exercises are a bit tricky!
If you get stuck, take a look at the file `hints.md` for some hints.
Please also don't hesitate to ask questions on Piazza or drop by
office hours.
